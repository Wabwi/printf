_printf is a function used for formatted printing. In this program we develop the function for simple printing and thekjlllllllhhh format specificatrions printing.

Depending oN the content in the (), this functions use the simple printing or the use of specifiers.

In this project I made the tasks 0 - 2 of mandatory part, and the 14 advanced tasks. The first task develop the function as such, only with the c, s and % specifiers. Then, the next task, add more specifiers.


We used a principal function called _printf() for give the string or specifiers to other function called check_format. In this second function search wich specifier is and and send it to other funtion that prints the correspondent argument.
